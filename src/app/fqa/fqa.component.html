          On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an
          official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel
          coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of
          this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In
          COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for
          disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel
          coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.
        </p>
        <p>
          A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously
          identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is
          not the same as the
          <span>coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans</span>
          and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
